Secretly she sneers
Another corporate show
A guilty conscience grows
I feel a guilty conscience grow
I feel a guilty conscience grow
She burns like the sun
I can't look away
she'll burn our horizons
make no mistakes
Come let the truth be shared
No-one ever dared
To break these endless lies
Secretly she cried
She burns like the sun
I can't look away
she'll burn our horizons
make no mistakes
I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
I'll run forever
I can't face the shame
And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame
Secretly she sneers
Another corporate show
A guilty conscience grows
I feel a guilty conscience grow
I feel a guilty conscience grow
She burns like the sun
I can't look away
she'll burn our horizons
make no mistakes
Come let the truth be shared
No-one ever dared
To break these endless lies
Secretly she cried
She burns like the sun
I can't look away
she'll burn our horizons
make no mistakes
I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
I'll run forever
I can't face the shame
And I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame
And fifteen thousand people scream
They were all begging for your dream
I'm falling down
Five thousand houses burning down, yeah
No one is gonna save this town
Too late, I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't here, no it wasn't here
I was calling your name
But you would never hear me sing
You wouldn't let me begin
So I'm crawling away
'Cause you broke my heart in two, yeah
No, I will not forget you
Too late, I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you, no
Falling away
You never see me through
No, I could not forget you
Falling down
A thousand houses burning down, yeah
No one is gonna save this town, yeah
Too late, I already found what I was looking for
You know it wasn't you
No, it wasn't you, no
Falling down
Now the world is upside down, yeah
I'm heading straight for the clouds
Choice to live my life extended
You could be the one I'll always love
You could be the one who listens to my deepest inquisitions
You could be the one I'll always love
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken pieces of the life I had before
First there was the one who challenged
All my dreams and all my balance
She could never be as good as you
You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You should be the one I'll always love
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken pieces of the life I had before
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken pieces of the life I had before
Before you...
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like a birth squeeze
The love for what you hide
The bitterness inside
Is growing like the newborn
When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere
Hopeless times to roam
The distance to your home
Fades away to nowhere
How much are you worth
You can't come down to earth
You're swelling up, you're unstoppable
'Cause you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere
Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
'Cause I'm drifting away
Away from you
Yeah, link it to the world
Link it to yourself
Stretch it like it's a birth squeeze
And the love for what you hide
And the bitterness inside
Is growing like the newborn
When you've seen, seen
Too much, too young, young
Soulless is everywhere
Destroy the spineless
Show me it's real
Wasting our last chance
To come away
Just break the silence
'Cause I'm drifting away
Away from you
The underneath's no big surprise
Now it's time for changing 
And cleansing everything 
To forget your love
My plug in baby 
Crucifies my enemies 
When I'm tired of giving 
My plug in baby 
In unbroken virgin realities 
Is tired of living
Don't confuse 
Baby you're gonna lose 
Your own game 
Change me 
Replace the envying 
To forget your love
My plug in baby 
Crucifies my enemies 
When I'm tired of giving 
My plug in baby 
In unbroken virgin realities 
Is tired of living
And I've seen your loving 
Mine is gone
And I've been in trouble
Asphyxiated
I wanna break this spell
That you've created
You're something beautiful
A contradiction
I wanna play the game
I want the friction
You will be the death of me
Yeah, you will be the death of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
I wanted freedom
Bound and restricted
I tried to give you up
But I'm addicted
Now that you know I'm trapped sense of elation
You'd never dream of
Breaking this fixation
You will squeeze the life out of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
How did it come to this?
Oh oh oh.. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh.. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh.. yeah yeah.. yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, you will suck the life out of me
Bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
Our time is running out
Our time is running out
You can't push it underground
You can't stop it screaming out
How did it come to this?
Oh oh oh.. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh.. yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh.. yeah yeah.. yeah yeah yeah
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful
Tiptoe to your room
A starlight in the gloom
I only dream of you
And you never knew
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, ooh
There's nowhere left to hide
In no one to confide
The truth burns deep inside
And will never die
Lips are turning blue
A kiss that can't renew
I only dream of you
My beautiful
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, hey
Sing for absolution
I will be singing
And falling from your grace, hey
Our wrongs remain unrectified
And our souls won't be exhumed
And twisting me around
Yeah I'm endlessly caving in
And turning inside out
'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
And I'm breaking out
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control
It's holding me, morphing me
And forcing me to strive
To be endlessly cold within
And dreaming I'm alive
'Cause I want it now
I want it now
Give me your heart and your soul
I'm not breaking down
I'm breaking out
Last chance to lose control
And I want you now
I want you now
I'll feel my heart implode
And I'm breaking out
Escaping now
Feeling my faith erode
