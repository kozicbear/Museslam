POEM: 
inquisitions forever like forever
soul down In too
fixation there of down
conscience Secretly of deep
sun there down always
show nowhere out away
grace never In down
time away for away
one First for Secretly
frame already to everywhere

POEM: 
it ca n't hear you roam what
you 'll n't give You run your
I be n't break it running You
I ca n't run you want I
You 're to bury I Bury me
you is to trapped I scream me
our did n't hide Our growing no
your are 's giving your had what
I be n't run it push me
I be n't Bury I hide our
